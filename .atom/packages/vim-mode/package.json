The\ncurrent focus is to ensure that an appropriate model is in place so that\noperators and motions can be incrementally added by the users who find\nthem useful as no one person uses all of vim's functionality.\n\n### Future Work (in rough order)\n\n* Visual mode\n  * ~~Characterwise~~\n  * Linewise\n  * Blockwise\n* Support for marks (including \\`.)\n* Support for `q` and `.`\n  * There is now partial support for `.`, full support is pending atom/atom#962\n* Differentiate between 0 for repetition and 0 for motion.\n* Block backspace in command mode.\n  * Block `ctrl-d` in insert mode.\n* More advanced keymap to support `iw` motion.\n  * Support for 'f' and 't'\n  * Handle `g{line}` and `gg`\n\n### Documentation\n\n* [Overview](docs/overview.md)\n* [Motions](docs/motions.md)\n* [Operators](docs/operators.md)\n* [Commands](docs/commands.md)\n\n### Development\n\n**Important** you'll need to be running a locally built version of Atom to\nrun tests.\n\nSee [the contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).\n",
